# pathwayReview
I am reading the paper by Dr. Draghici "Identifying significantly impacted pathways: a comprehensive review and assessment" (https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-019-1790-4). I found it very useful and Dr. Draghici shared his student's github repositories. I fork Nguyen's respositories and start to build my own starting from learning from Nguyen.
